* Mozilla

Goals
* Ownership
* Whole-picture knowledge

Story of Moz Deployments
* Feature-based: maybe once/month, several hours, manual, risky
* Time-based: weekly, scripted, < 1 hour, safer from practice
* Continuous: several times/day, minutes, push-button, non-events

Triforce
* Wisdom: Insight into the system, feedback loops
* Courage: Confidence from tests/etc
* Power: Automated deployments

Wisdom:
* Real-time business-level information: StatsD, NewRelic, Sentry
* Bug reports from staff, community

Courage:
* Automated tests
* Repeatable processes
* Confidence is hard to measure
* Blameless post-mortems

Power:

* Any dead-simple interface, e.g. big-red-button, Fabric
* Feature flags
