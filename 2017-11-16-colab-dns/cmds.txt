# Let's start at a root server.
dig @j.root-servers.net. www.them.us any
# Authority section, no Answer, gives us NS records.
# Additional section bootstraps the rest of the lookups. Can't lookup .us. if you need to know where is .us.

# OK, let's ask one of those servers.
dig @b.cctld.us. www.them.us any
# Still authority but no answer, and more NS records.

# Let's ask one of the them.us zone NS, but just leave off the subdomain for now
dig @ns-528.awsdns-02.net. them.us any
# A bunch of records, including A, NS, SOA.

# Back to subdomain
dig @ns-528.awsdns-02.net. www.them.us any
# Authority AND answer!

# A lot of work. Let's try a different kind of server, a resolver:
# 8.8.8.8 is Google/public DNS resolver.
dig @8.8.8.8 www.them.us any
# Answer, but no authority.

# Let's do the defaultest thing
dig www.them.us
# Uses computer/network defined resolver.
# Defaults to "IN A" not "IN ANY"
# Gets a CNAME but also the A records for that CNAME!

# Try that query against the authority?
dig @ns-528.awsdns-02.net. www.them.us A
# Just the CNAME. Authoritative but not recursive/resolver.
# Caches in recursive resolvers lead to propagation time.

sudo tcpdump -nnXSs 0 udp port 53
