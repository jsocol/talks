# Who are you? Intro to the DNS

- The DNS!
- Where are we going?
  - There's a difference between the protocol and the system itself.
- _The_ Domain Name _System_
  - Why?
    - Numbers suck. Map to names.
    - Distribute and delegate control of parts of it.
  - Resource Record
    - Building block of DNS
    - (Name, Class, Type, Data)
    - e.g. (@, 1, A, "1.2.3.4")
    - Key types (A/AAAA, NS, MX, CNAME, SOA, TXT)
  - Hierarchical
    - TLDs (.com, .org, .net, .uk, etc)
    - A section makes up a "Zone"
    - Root of the hierarchy (will come back)
  - Anatomy of hierarchy and authority
    - e.g. www.wired.com
    - NS for .com knows about NS record for wired.com
    - NS for wired.com knows about record www.wired.com
    - could have NS for www that knew about something.www.wired.com
  - Root hierarchy
    - What if you don't know about ".com"?
    - "13" root servers
    - Each a global network of servers
  - Demo time!
    - dig is a tool
    - dig @root www.wired.com any (only points us at com)
    - dig @com www.wired.com any (only gives us nameservers)
    - dig @wired-ns www.wired.com any (gives us useful records)
    - dig @8.8.8.8 www.wired.com any (answer w/o authority)
  - Alternate roots exist
- The DNS protocol
  - Dense, binary
    - Show bytes 0-31
    - tcpdump
      - it's a tool too
      - it does things
    - demo again
  - Structure
    - Question section
    - Answer section
    - Authority section
  - Recursion
    - Servers can make requests
    - Cache for TTL
    - Non-authoritative answers
  - Propagation
